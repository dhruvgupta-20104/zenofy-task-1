# How to Run this Vite React App

Follow the steps below to set up and run a Vite React app that uses Tailwind CSS.

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvgupta-20104/zenofy-task-1.git
```

## 2. Move into the repository

```bash
cd zenofy-task-1
```

## 3. Install the dependencies

All the required dependencies will be install using the below command

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### This will start the react app by default on the port 5173.

# Points of importance

1. I have used React JS and tailwind to create the front end of the app.
2. The website is responsive and you should try it on smaller screens. 
3. The code structure is modular and easy to understand.
